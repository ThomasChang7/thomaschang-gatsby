##Hi all!

It's been about a month since I started working on my personal site and I experienced many challenges along the way. I wanted nothing flashy so I went with a minimalist feel. 

This site uses GatsbyJS, which uses React and GraphQL. In addition, I used styled components. This site is deployed on Netlify and originally I wanted a .com extension but it was taken! So instead, I went with .io

###Process

####GatsbyJS
The first challenge was to figure out which technologies I want to use to generate my site. Being a fan of React, I decided to look into GatsbyJS.

####GraphQL
GraphQL changed the way I looked at APIs. It transforms the way data is fetched. It can reduce the amount of requests we send to access data on the server. In a REST API, one may end up making multiple requests to several different endpoints. With GraphQL, there is only one endpoint that one needs to make in order to receive data. 

####CSS
I wanted to explore the idea of CSS-in-JS (what that sounds bizarre!). It can be a controversial topic but I personally like the way components are maintained individually. I always feel like I'm lost when I have to maintain large amounts of stylesheets. 
Also, I did not want to rely on bootstrap or other libaries for designing this project. I wanted to truly make it my own so I decided to implement it from scratch. Through that, I learned more about responsive design and flexbox. 

###Reflections
I could've kept working obsessively on my personal site as there are a lot of things I want to add in such as animations, and little responsive items. I did not expect to learn GraphQL nor did I expect to gain a strong opinion on CSS in JS. However, I decided to pause on designing it for now and instead focus on my other projects and my job applications. I will still continue to post on the blog about the things I am building/learning. If you reached this point, thanks for reading! :)
