##Hi all!

It's been about a month since I started working on my personal site and I experienced many challenges along the way. I wanted nothing flashy so I went with a minimalist feel. 

This site uses GatsbyJS, which uses React and GraphQL. In addition, I used styled components. This site is deployed on Netlify and originally I wanted a .com extension but it was taken! Plus .io is nifty.

###Process

####GatsbyJS
The first challenge I faced was coding up a template from scratch. I decided to go with GatbyJS to generate my site. I was thinking of using Jekyll but being a fan of React, I decided to go with this route instead. 

####GraphQL
I also didn't really understand GraphQL until I started on this site. I went through the tutorials and I learned that it was pretty freaking awesome. Being to fetch just the perfect amount of data doesn't sound like much initially until one realizes how often data is over fetched or under fetched. That could be a lot of data on a data plan! It isn't too hard to learn and were handy tutorials everywhere.

####CSS
I wanted to mess with CSS in JS because I didn't want to maintain a huge style sheet. I felt the idea of abstracting the CSS model to a component level was very appealing. Did it help my workflow? Honestly speaking, I have no idea, but I was happy along the way and passing in props can be useful as a lot of my components change if it's viewed on a phone, tablet, or computer. In the end I fell in love with CSS in JSS.
I didn't want to use any libraries for designing the site because I wanted to level up my CSS skills. Instead of using libaries such as bootstrap or materialize, I decided to make the css from scratch. CSS has always been my weakpoint but nevertheless, I decided to approach it with a desire to learn. From building my personal site, I had a lot of fun learning responsive design, flexbox, and simple cool effects from hovering over certain elements. 

###Reflections
I could've kept working obsessively on my personal site as there are a lot of things I want to add in, such as animations, SEO, and little responsive items. However, the more I obsess over it, the less perfect it becomes and I'll never stop working on tiny items that only I notice. Nothing is 100% perfect and it was a humbling experience and it's at this point where I'll work less on this site and instead on other side projects. I still on planning on changing things up here and there but for now, I'll slow down. If you made it this far, thanks for reading! :)
