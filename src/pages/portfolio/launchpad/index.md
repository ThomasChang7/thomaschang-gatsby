##Introduction

One of my earliest projects when learning development. After learning HTML, CSS, and jQuery, I set out to have fun with my new coding chops. I wanted to be engaged and entertained while I was coding and wanted to make something that involves sounds and music. 

##“Launchpad”

Modeled after the Novation Launchpad, an 8x8 grid of illuminated buttons that could be used to trigger sounds.

##Process

My first challenge was to make an 8x8 grid and have each row correlate with a different color. I used a simple for loop to set it up. Then, I needed to use jQuery to have each button light up after clicking on it so I would add a class and remove a class after lighting it up. 
The biggest challenge was figuring out how to play sound and have it correspond with a button. Turns out, there is an audio tag in html and all I needed to do was provide a source for the sound (specifically the .wav files).

##Conclusion

Making this was definitely fun and helped me learned a lot about DOM manipulation. I definitely had to use a lot of clever thinking to map specific sounds to specific squares
